You are designing a software for the university’s library. In which
both teachers and students can issue new books or renew already issued book. 
A student can issue up to 5 books at one time and there is no limit of books for teachers. 
Only the librarian can add and remove the books in the system. Only the librarian can add and remove students and teachers in the system. 
The librarian firstly logs into the system, then authenticate the students using his/her roll number. He also checks how many books have been issued to that student. Librarian can search the books by ID, title, author name, publisher, etc. 
Students have to show their ‘student ID cards’ to issue the books. The Librarian firstly checks the books availability before issuing them. 
Students have to return the books within 30 days of book issuance. There is no time limit imposed on teachers. 
If student fails to do so, a fine will be imposed by the librarian which student will pay before issuing or renewing books.
